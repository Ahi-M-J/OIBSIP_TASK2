      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Rani Lakshmi Bai was born on November 19, 1828 in Varanasi, India. Her birth name was Manikarnika. Her father was Moropant Tambe 
        and her mother was Bhagirathi
         Sapre. Her mother passed away when she was four years old and her father worked for the Peshwa of Bithoor district. Growing up with 
         the boys in the Peshwaâ€™s 
         court, she was trained in martial arts and became proficient in sword fighting and riding.</p>
      <h2>Marriage and Family</h2>
      <p>In May 1842, she was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She gave birth to a son in 1851, but he died
         after four months. 
        In November 1853, her husband also passed away. Following established Hindu tradition, just before his death the maharaja adopted a 
        boy as his heir. 
        Lord Dalhousie, the British governor-general of India, refused to recognize the adopted heir and annexed Jhansi in accordance with the doctrine of lapse.</p>
      <h2>Rebellion</h2>
      <p>In May 1857, the Indian Rebellion began. Rani Lakshmi Bai became one of the leading figures of the rebellion. She fought against the British East India 
        Company and defended Jhansi from being annexed. She died on June 18, 1858 while fighting in battle. The queen refused to cede Jhansi to the British.
         Shortly after the beginning of the mutiny in Meerut, Lakshmi Bai was proclaimed the regent of Jhansi, and she ruled on behalf of the minor heir. Joining 
         the uprising against the British, she rapidly organized her troops and assumed charge of the rebels in the Bundelkhand region. Dressed as a man, she fought a 
         fierce battle against the British forces at the Battle of Kotah-ki-Serai on June 17, 1858, and was killed in combat.</p>

    <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Rani Lakshmi Bai's legacy as a brave and fearless warrior continues to inspire generations. Her role in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 symbolizes the 
                indomitable spirit of resistance against colonial oppression. She remains a symbol of women's empowerment and the fight for freedom and justice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several memorials, statues, and institutions have been dedicated to Rani Lakshmi Bai across India. Her contributions to the struggle for independence 
                have been celebrated in literature, art, and cinema. She is remembered as a true patriot and an icon of courage, and her life story serves as a beacon 
                of hope and inspiration for people worldwide.
